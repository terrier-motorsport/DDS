"""
This base class outlines the essential functionality required by all interface devices, which is to manage 
device initialization, periodic data updates, data caching, and logging. Specific device classes (e.g., 
I2C pressure/temperature sensors) can inherit from this base class and implement device-specific logic for 
initialization and data updates. These child classes will call the base class methods to manage common behavior 
and focus on implementing the unique features of their respective devices.

This approach allows for easy scalability and maintainability as new types of devices are added to the system, 
ensuring that common functionality (caching, logging, status management) is reused across devices while 
still allowing for device-specific logic.

# ===== Parent class for all interfaces =====
class Interface(ABC):

    '''
    The purpose of this file is to provide an abstract base class for creating interfaces.
    An interface as defined as an object which interfaces with a data transmission protocol (Ex. CAN)
    and contains devices on that protocol.

    Abstract Description:
        The core functionality provided by this class is common to all interfaces, including methods for updating and retrieving data, handling cache, 
        managing the status of the device, and logging messages. Child classes representing specific types of interfaces should inherit from this class 
        and implement or override certain methods to tailor the behavior for the specific interface they represent.

    Using the Interface Class:
        The `initialize()` method should be called once to set up the interface before it is used. 
        The `update()` method should be called as often as possible to update the device's data.

    Methods Inherited from the Base Class:
        - `get_name()`: Returns the name of the interface device.
        - `get_protocol()`: Returns the protocol used by the interface (e.g., CAN, I2C).
        - `get_data()`: Retrieves the most recent cached data for the specified key. 
        - `log()`: Logs messages to a provided logger for tracking the status and events related to the device.
        
    Device Status:
        The `status` attribute reflects the state of the interface and can be one of the following:
            - `ACTIVE`: The interface is functioning and polling data.
            - `DISABLED`: The interface is inactive and not being polled.
            - `ERROR`: An error occurred, and the interface will attempt to be re-initialized.
            - `NOT_INITIALIZED`: The interface has not been initialized yet.
    '''

    class InterfaceStatus(Enum):
        '''
        This keeps track of the state of the interface.
        
        ACTIVE: Data is being polled constantly.
        DISABLED: The interface is ignored.
        ERROR: There was an error polling data and the interface will attempt to be re-initialized.
        NOT_INITIALIZED: The interface has not been initialized yet.
        '''

        Initializes an interface device with the given parameters.

        This constructor should handle initialization code that is not expected to raise an error.
        Any logic that involves interacting with physical devices should be placed in the `initialize()` 
        method to ensure proper error handling during the initialization process.

        This constructor should be called by child classes to properly initialize the common aspects 
        of the interface device. Child classes must then implement their own `__init__()` and `initialize()` 
        methods to handle device-specific initialization.

        Parameters:
            name (str): The name of the interface device.
            sensorProtocol (InterfaceProtocol): The protocol used by the sensor interface (e.g., I2C, CAN).
            logger (DataLogger): A logger instance for logging device-related messages.

        Attributes:
            sensorProtocol (InterfaceProtocol): The protocol used by the sensor interface.
            name (str): The name of the device.
            log (DataLogger): Logger instance used for logging messages.
            status (Status): The current status of the device, initially set to `NOT_INITIALIZED`.
            cached_values (dict): A dictionary used to store cached sensor readings.
            last_cache_update (float): Timestamp of the last cache update.
